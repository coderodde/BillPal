# Want to help?

I would really prefer to maintain the application on my own for pedagogic reasons and due to the fact that I need to improve my portfolio. **However**, I would really appreciate if someone would find and report bugs in BillPal. If you do, I would gladfully mention your effort here at Github and/or BillPal homepage. Whenever you find an opportunity for improvement, consider making an issue here at GitHub and/or send an email at rodionef(at)cs.helsinki.fi
